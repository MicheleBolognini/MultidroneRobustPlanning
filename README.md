# Multidrone Robust Planning Toolbox

# Requirements
This toolbox relies on LKH to solve TSP instances. It is therefore necessary to download it and compile it,
 so that the resulting LKH script is located in the "LKH" folder


#TODO
- CHECK LKH COMPILATION PROCEDURE
- Make solver parameters do stuff (graph conn minimization, matlab/cplex solver
- Show drone failure in the last graph
